# SCRS-Adalo-Geologger
Simple JS component requested by SCRS-IL Center.

This is a simple component created for the Adalo low-code platform. 
No Geo location is avaliable for users of adalo, however SCRS needed to track user locations in their application.
This plugin allows the collection of user location (with consent) within an Adalo project. The user location is then
stored on ITC server, which reverse-geocodes the user LAT/LNG and pushes the information to the SCRS Adalo DB.
